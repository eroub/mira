## Summary Output of AMIRA-GARCH can be interpreted as follows

Dep. Variable: shows the dependent variable, in your case it's the differenced closing values of Bitcoin.  
R-Squared: the coefficient of determination which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. A low R-squared value, close to 0, suggests that the model is not capturing much of the variance in the data.  
Mean Model: shows the mean model used, which is HAR (Historical Average Return) in your case.  
Vol Model: shows the volatility model used, which is GJR-GARCH.  
Log-Likelihood: the log-likelihood value of the model, which measures the goodness of fit of the model. The larger the value, the better the fit.  
AIC: the Akaike Information Criterion, which measures the goodness of fit of the model while penalizing the model for having too many parameters.  
BIC: the Bayesian Information Criterion, which is similar to AIC but has a higher penalty for having too many parameters.  
No. Observations: the number of observations used in the model.  
Date: the date when the model was run.  
Time: the time when the model was run.  

### The rest of the output provides the coefficients of the parameters in the model and their standard errors, t-statistics, P-values, and confidence intervals.

Const: the constant term in the mean model.  
omega: the long-run unconditional variance parameter.  
gamma[1], gamma[2]: the autoregressive and moving average coefficients in the volatility model.  
beta[1]: the weighting of the past squared residuals in the volatility model.  
nu: the degree of freedom parameter in the distribution.
